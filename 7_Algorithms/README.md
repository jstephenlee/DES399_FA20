### Assignment
This assignment will continue to explore the possibilities of objects and arrays. Objects allow us to create templates and arrays make it easy to create many versions.

Write at least two classes. Use a timer to toggle between classes or turn classes on and off in layered fashion. Use arrays to generate multiple instances to build an animated background. Think about ways to change movement, color, form, scale, etc. over time. Experiment with different ranges of values. How are the values generated or mapped? How can you control and manipulate the timer? Save different versions as you go along as you work towards a satisfying solution.
