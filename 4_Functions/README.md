Functions allow us to create modular and reusable structures.

Three parts
* Return type (void, int, float, String, etc.)
* Function name
* Arguments (values that are passed into a function)
\-Parameters are variables declarations inside the function definition

```returnType functionName(parameters){\```\
```//execute this code\```\
```}```

## Assignment

Write two functions and use them in both a pattern sketch and a drawing tool sketch.
