### Assignment
This assignment will combine what we learned about objects and arrays. Objects allow us to create templates and arrays make it easy to create many versions.

The assignment is open, so be creative. Write at least one class and use an array to generate multiple instances to build an animated background. Think about ways to change movement, color, form, scale, etc. over time. Experiment with different ranges of values. How are the values generated or mapped? Save different versions as you go along as you work towards a satisfying solution.
